# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5: Matplotlib

# Overview of the analysis: 
The following analysis is a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer to determine their future strategic approach.
## Results: 
As shown in the table below, there’s a great deal of variation in rider data between the various city types. Naturally the “Urban” city type will have a larger population, thus resulting in a larger volume of rides, drivers, total fares, and average fares per ride and driver. The opposite is of course true for the “Rural” city type with a smaller population.

### Summary: 
Every day there are thousands of events that take place within the PyBer marketplace. Every minute there are riders that make requests for a ride, driver-partners start trips, and hungry users order food delivery. Each of these events happens at a specific time and location…and each event provides a data point that can be measured and used to improve operations for PyBer and better understand their marketplace in which they operate. 
With all of these events taking place somewhere everyday – and many times at all hours of the day – how do you scale your business model for demand without adversely impacting revenue, while still accounting for the various disparities and demographics based on city location? 
The following are some recommendations for addressing some disparities based on location (or city types):
1.	Consider analyzing the existing data across different city types and then approaching this with a digital interface that has all of the relevant factors imbedded within its algorithms to optimize indexing locations. Each rider event offers a data point with key information that provides insight into improving PyBer operations that can be applied to a single location and refined over time. Analysis on areas, such as neighborhoods within a city is a practical approach. The rider assignment and dispatch can leverage this software to better assign driver volumes, shift times, and scale pricing based on peak times.
2.	Expand the date timeframe (e.g., the full year) being analyzed for more accurate measures and analyze whether there is consistent or inconsistent rider demand based on city types. Consider seasonal trends and adjust staffing/vehicles as needed. There may be some areas that could use more or less drivers based on these trends.
3.	 Consider scaling operations for areas in rural areas as these are more notorious for not having robust internet access and/or connectivity. This would certainly be a factor worth considering as it would have a negative impact on operations and drive down revenue.
